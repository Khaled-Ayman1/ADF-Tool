**Upcoming features... priority TOP to BOTTOM


- Adding CSV support

- Adding feature to print out droppable_rows into a new sheet/file

- Implement CLI commands for Beta build launch

- Fix df not exported as table bug in .xlsx files

- Increase duplicates determination accuracy by replacing pd.duplicates with own implementation (User input errors/String casting)

- Allow for substring misprints, 1-3 chars of mismatch (String Duplicates)


** Alpha phase bugs (Over 10k rows of data tested):

- #CRITICAL# auto_fill resulted in duplicates being all the same in length (suggested solution: make it fill na for complete row)

- inaccuracy in pandas df.duplicates

- Lack of Performance with string data (No duplicates found)
